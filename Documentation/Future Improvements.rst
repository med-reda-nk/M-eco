Future Improvements
===================

Several enhancements are planned to increase model robustness and project impact:

- **Advanced Feature Engineering**:
  Incorporate additional macroeconomic and sentiment indicators, as well as external shocks or policy changes.

- **Model Ensembling**:
  Blend predictions from multiple models to reduce variance and improve forecasting accuracy.

- **Probabilistic Forecasting**:
  Implement models that provide prediction intervals, enabling risk-aware decision-making.

- **Explainability**:
  Develop interpretable AI components to better understand and trust model decisions.

- **Real-time Data Integration**:
  Automate the ingestion of new data for continuous updates and model retraining.

- **Dashboard Enhancements**:
  Add more interactive features and user customization options to improve the user experience.

- **Scalability**:
  Deploy models using scalable cloud infrastructure to support production-grade forecasting services.
