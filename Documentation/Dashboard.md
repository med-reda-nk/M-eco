# Dashboard
A dynamic and interactive dashboard was developed to visualize:

Historical trends and seasonality of each indicator.

Real-time model forecasts alongside actual data.

Model performance metrics comparison.


The dashboard enables users to select specific time ranges, indicators, to customize their analysis. It is built using [e.g., HTML, CSS, JS], providing an intuitive interface for economic analysts and stakeholders.
